# Millionaire Trivia
This project is a digital version of the popular game show **"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"** where players answer a series of increasingly difficult trivia questions in order to win a virtual million dollars.

The questions are sourced from the Open Trivia Database API, which provides a wide range of categories and difficulties for the questions.

# How to Play
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The game will start immediately and you will be presented with the first question.

Each question will have four possible answers, and you must select the correct one in order to proceed to the next question. If you answer a question incorrectly, the game will end and you will have the option to start again from the beginning.

If you successfully answer all 15 questions, you will win the virtual million dollars!
